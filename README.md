## ⚠️ Academic Integrity

- ✅ Discuss concepts with classmates
- ✅ Use online documentation and tutorials
- ✅ Ask TAs and instructor for help
- ✅ Use AI tools (if cited)
- ❌ Copy code from others
- ❌ Share your solutions
- ❌ Submit someone else's work

**Remember:** Cite any sources, help, or AI tools you use!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "NameError: name 'X' is not defined"
- Did you run all cells above in order?
- Check for typos in variable names

### "AssertionError"
- Your function isn't producing the expected output
- Read the docstring carefully
- Check the test case to see what's expected
- Add print statements to debug

### "IndentationError"
- Python requires consistent indentation
- Use either tabs or spaces (not both)
- Standard is 4 spaces per indent level

### Tests Won't Run
- Make sure you've implemented the function (not just `pass`)
- Check that your return statement is inside the function
- Verify your function name matches exactly

**Good luck!** 🎷🏀🦅
